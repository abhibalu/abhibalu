## 👋 Hi there, I'm Abhijith 👨‍💻

I'm a Data Engineer & AI Builder with over 6 years of experience in building scalable data pipelines, now focused on bridging **Data Engineering** with **Agentic AI**.

### 🚀 Featured Project: [AI Job Agent](https://github.com/abhibalu/AI_Job_seeking)
I built an autonomous, full-stack AI agent to revolutionize the job application process. It's not just a demo—it's a functioning data product that simplifies the hunt.

**Key Capabilities:**
*   **🕷️ Intelligent Scraping:** Automated pipelines (Apify) to aggregate jobs from LinkedIn & Glassdoor.
*   **🧠 Context-Aware AI Tailoring:** Uses LLMs to analyze unstructured job data and rewrite specific resume sections (Summary, Experience) using a "Golden Skills" reference list.
*   **📊 Smart Evaluation:** Automatically scores jobs and detects "Gap Analysis" to identify missing skills.
*   **⚙️ Modern Stack:** Built with **FastAPI**, **React**, **Supabase** (Vector DB), and **Docker**.

### 🌱 What I'm up to:
-   **Building AI Agents:** Moving beyond simple wrappers to create agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows (like my Job Agent).
-   **Cloud-Native Engineering:** Orchestrating messy, real-world data pipelines using Airflow, dbt, and Cloud Platforms (GCP/Azure/AWS).
-   **Sharing Knowledge:** documenting my journey in building production-grade AI systems.

### 🤝 Collaboration
I'm looking for challenging opportunities in **AI Engineering** or **Data Engineering**. If you're building systems that need robust data foundations and intelligent decision-making, let's talk.
