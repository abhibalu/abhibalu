## 👋 Hi there, I'm Abhijith 👨‍💻

I'm a data professional with around 3 years of industry experience, currently expanding my skills into the world of **AI** and **LLMs**. I'm particularly interested in how large language models can be integrated into real-world data systems to create more intelligent workflows.

### 🌱 What I'm up to:
- Working on **web scraping projects** involving **messy, real-world data**, and using them as a launchpad to deepen my skills in **data modeling**, **orchestration**, and **cloud-native pipelines**
- Exploring **LLM-powered apps and workflows** to understand their practical value in the data landscape
- Actively **sharing my learnings and notes** here through projects and repositories

### 🤝 Collaboration
I'm always up for collaborating on challenging **data engineering** or **LLM-based projects** that offer opportunities to learn, build, and grow through real-world problem-solving.

### 📫 How to reach me
Feel free to reach out: **abhiji001@gmail.com**
